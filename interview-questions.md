# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Functional programming stores and manipulates data by functions. Object-oriented stores and manipulates data through objects.

  Researched answer: Object oriented programming stores and operates in a collection of objects. Concepts of  OOP are abstraction: where the important parts of an object's properties and behaviors are  identified and viewed, these behaviors are also what diffrenciate it from other objects. Encapsulation wraps up data in a class. Inheritance, where one class can use features listed from another class. Polymorphism can differentiate between data listed under the same name. Functional programming the data is fixed, its main concept is abstarction of data. It's composed of functions only



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Floats are not whole numbers, they're decimals. Integers are whole numbers

  and  .odd. Floats are frational numbers (decimal values), built-in methods can be used on floats to convert them to whole numbers .ceil rounds a float up and .floor rounds a float down.


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Returns the value of the code put in automatically.
